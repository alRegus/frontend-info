            <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
            the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
            technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
            page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
            (JavaScript).<br />

            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
            either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
            fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
            and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an
            active participant in the World Wide Web. <br />

            HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
            display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements"
            such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;header&gt;,
            &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;p&gt;,
            &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;,
            &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;canvas&gt;, &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;details&gt;,
            &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;output&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;,
            &lt;video&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt; and many others.
            <br />

            An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags",
            which consist of the element surrounded by "<" and ">" . The name of
            an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be
            written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the
            &lt;title&gt; tag can be written as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or
            in any other way.

            <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media.<br />

            CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
            across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously,
            development of various parts of CSS specification was done
            synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest
            recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3.
            However, CSS4 has never become an official version.<br />

            From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly
            and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much,
            that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
            separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
            W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of
            the CSS specification.

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.<br />

            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not
            the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.
            For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web
            APIs and DOM.<br />

            The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language
            Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API
            specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout
            MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402.
            And in cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have
            already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in
            MDN articles may use some of those new features.<br />

            Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both
            "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of
            Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming
            languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.

            <h2>ReactJS</h2>

          <div class="description">
            React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
            for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from
            small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.<br />
            React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook,
            who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was
            influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first
            deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in
            2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.<br />

            React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development
            with React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015
            and open-sourced in March 2015.<br />

            On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of
            internal algorithms for rendering, as opposed to React's old
            rendering algorithm, Stack. React Fiber was to become the foundation
            of any future improvements and feature development of the React
            library. The actual syntax for programming with React does not
            change; only the way that the syntax is executed has changed.
            React's old rendering system, Stack, was developed at a time when
            the focus of the system on dynamic change was not understood. Stack
            was slow to draw complex animation, for example, trying to
            accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into
            segments that can be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the
            structure of a page can be broken into segments that may be
            maintained and updated separately. JavaScript functions and virtual
            DOM objects are called "fibers", and each can be operated and
            updated separately, allowing for smoother on-screen rendering.<br />

            On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.<br />

            On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public. The
            release introduced React Hooks.<br />

            On August 10, 2020, the React team announced the first release
            candidate for React v17.0, notable as the first major release
            without major changes to the React developer-facing API.
